  aboutParagraphOne:
    'Assessing digital competence from an organisational perspective is a challenging process. The EU Digital Competence Framework for Citizens is a comprehensive and logical overview of what digital competence means, and it meaingfully categorizes skills, competencies, and attitudes to help individuals assess and grow their competence. However, looking at digital competence from the perspective of a team, an organisation, is a different dimension of competence, for which we felt that the original framework deserved a focused tool.',
  aboutParagraphTwo:
    'This self-diagnostic tool extends the EU digital competence framework into the territory of organisational maturity: what does it mean for an organisation to be digitally competent? the EaP team, together with coaches for their Digital Competence course, translated the framework into organisational maturity areas, so that teams and orgs can reflect on their digital competence from a space of policies, best practices, capacity building, and peer/partner support. The tool is designed with Civil Society in mind, specifically groups from EaP countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine). However, it can be a helpful resource for any team, company, or organisation intent on becoming more intentional about their digital competence progress.',

  aboutParagraphFour:
    'If you are surprised with the results - perhaps it would be an interesting and useful exercise to ask a colleague to fill out the self-assessment tool, so that you can cross-reference and compare your respective results, identifying in the process the causes behind eventual discrepancies. If you are pleased with the results, it might be an excellent opportunity to see in what ways some of your current practices could be further codified, standardized and institutionalized across policies and organisational key processes and practices.',
